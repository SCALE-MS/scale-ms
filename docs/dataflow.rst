Data flow API
=============

Client code describes work by constructing data flow driven graphs of the
operations that implement a research protocol or high level computational
method.
Graphs and adaptive logic are communicated to the execution middleware,
which manages task execution to satisfy the data dependencies for the results
requested by the client script.
